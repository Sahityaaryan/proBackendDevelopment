Here we will create a backend for youtube clone

### Important notes:

1. when do we have to store the images we don't store it in the regular db we use any third parties cloud service for it like cloudinary or any other but still we have to store the images temporarily into a "temp" dir in the "public" dir.

2. the problem of git that it doesn't track empty dir and the "temp" will be empty so we make a ".gitkeep" file in it. 

3. There are many .gitignore generators that will generate the .gitignore file for you. for eg [.gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore)
